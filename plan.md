## Project Overview
This document outlines the masterplan for creating a "Color Palette Generator," a client-side single-page application (SPA) built with Next.js. The application will allow users to generate, view, save, and export color palettes for their design projects. It will feature a modern, responsive interface with both light and dark themes, prioritize performance, and operate entirely on the client-side without a backend.

## Project Goals
- To provide a fast, intuitive, and beautiful tool for designers and developers to create color palettes.
- To enable users to generate palettes either randomly or based on a specific seed color using established color harmony rules.
- To allow users to save their favorite palettes locally and export them in useful formats (JSON, PNG).
- To deliver a highly performant, lightweight, and responsive user experience.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state (theme, saved palettes)
- **Color Manipulation**: `tinycolor2` for color parsing, manipulation, and harmony generation.
- **Image Export**: `html-to-image` for converting the palette display to a downloadable PNG.
- **Icons**: `lucide-react` for a lightweight and consistent icon set.
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Project Scope
### In Scope
- Generation of 5-color palettes.
- Palette generation from a random seed.
- Palette generation from a user-provided seed color (HEX).
- User selection of color harmony model (complementary, analogous, triadic) for seed-based generation.
- Display of color HEX codes and one-click copying to the clipboard.
- Saving and deleting palettes to/from the browser's `localStorage`.
- A dedicated "Saved Palettes" view.
- Exporting a palette as a JSON file or a PNG image.
- A responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Light and dark theme support, with user preference saved in `localStorage`.

### Out of Scope
- User accounts and cloud-based synchronization of palettes.
- A dedicated backend server.
- Support for color formats other than HEX for input/copying (e.g., RGBA, HSLA).
- Community features for sharing or browsing palettes from other users.
- Naming palettes.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Palette Generation
- **FR1.1:** A "Generate" button shall trigger the creation of a new, random 5-color palette.
- **FR1.2:** Users shall be able to input a single HEX color code as a "seed."
- **FR1.3:** When a seed color is provided, users shall be able to select a harmony model (e.g., complementary, analogous, triadic) to generate the rest of the palette.
- **FR1.4:** The generated palette shall be immediately displayed in the main view.

### FR2: Palette Interaction
- **FR2.1:** Each color in the palette shall be displayed as a distinct visual block.
- **FR2.2:** The HEX code for each color shall be visible.
- **FR2.3:** Clicking on a color's HEX code or a "copy" icon shall copy the HEX code to the user's clipboard and show a temporary confirmation (e.g., "Copied!").
- **FR2.4:** A "Save" button (e.g., a heart icon) shall be present for the currently displayed palette, allowing it to be persisted in `localStorage`.

### FR3: Saved Palettes & Export
- **FR3.1:** Users shall be able to view a list or grid of their saved palettes.
- **FR3.2:** Each saved palette shall have a "Delete" button to remove it from `localStorage`.
- **FR3.3:** Users shall be able to load a saved palette back into the main generator view.
- **FR3.4:** Users shall have an option to export the current palette as a JSON file (containing an array of HEX codes).
- **FR3.5:** Users shall have an option to export the current palette as a PNG image.

### FR4: User Interface
- **FR4.1:** The application shall feature a toggle switch to change between light and dark themes.
- **FR4.2:** The selected theme preference shall be persisted across sessions using `localStorage`.
- **FR4.3:** The layout shall be responsive, adjusting the palette display and controls for optimal viewing on various screen sizes.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
- **Performance:** The application must be fast and responsive. The initial JavaScript bundle size for the main page should be under 200 KB. Page loads and palette generation should feel instantaneous.
- **Scalability:** While client-side, the application should handle storing up to 100 palettes in `localStorage` without performance degradation.
- **Maintainability:** Code will be written in TypeScript, well-structured into reusable components and utility functions, and formatted consistently.
- **Accessibility:** The UI must be keyboard-navigable, and color contrasts for text and UI elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Interactive elements should have clear focus states.
- **Portability:** As a web application, it must run correctly on the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Implementation Plan
This section outlines the implementation plan. It is detailed enough for an AI code assistant to implement the final product without additional input.

### Phase 1: Setup & Foundation
- **Task 1: Initialize Next.js Project**
    - Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript and the App Router.
    - Command: `npx create-next-app@latest color-palette-generator --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app`
- **Task 2: Install Core Dependencies**
    - Add `zustand`, `tinycolor2`, `html-to-image`, and `lucide-react`.
    - Command: `npm install zustand tinycolor2 html-to-image lucide-react`
- **Task 3: Project Structure Setup**
    - Create the following directories inside the `app/` directory:
        - `components/`: For reusable React components.
        - `store/`: For Zustand state management stores.
        - `lib/`: For utility functions (e.g., color generation, local storage).
        - `styles/`: For global CSS.
- **Task 4: Basic Layout and Theming**
    - Create a main layout file `app/layout.tsx` that includes the basic HTML structure.
    - Implement the theme provider using a library like `next-themes` to handle light/dark mode switching.
    - Add a theme toggle component (e.g., `ThemeSwitcher.tsx`) in the header or footer.

### Phase 2: Core Functionality - Palette Generation & Display
- **Task 1: Create Color Generation Logic**
    - In `lib/colors.ts`, create a function `generateRandomPalette()` that returns an array of 5 random HEX color strings.
    - Create a function `generateHarmonyPalette(seedColor: string, harmony: 'analogous' | 'triadic' | 'complementary')` using `tinycolor2` to generate a 5-color palette based on the input.
- **Task 2: Build the Main Page UI**
    - In `app/page.tsx`, set up the main user interface.
    - Create a `PaletteDisplay` component in `components/PaletteDisplay.tsx` that takes an array of color strings and renders them as vertical strips.
    - Each strip within `PaletteDisplay` should be a `ColorCard` component (`components/ColorCard.tsx`) that shows the color, its HEX code, and a copy button with an icon.
- **Task 3: Implement State Management**
    - In `store/paletteStore.ts`, create a Zustand store to manage the `currentPalette` state.
    - Connect the main page to this store so that generating a new palette updates the state and re-renders the `PaletteDisplay`.
- **Task 4: Implement Generation Controls**
    - Add a "Generate" button that calls the `generateRandomPalette` function and updates the store.
    - Add an input field for the user to enter a seed HEX color.
    - Add radio buttons or a dropdown to select the color harmony model.
    - When the seed or harmony model changes, call `generateHarmonyPalette` and update the store.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features - Saving & Exporting
- **Task 1: Implement Local Storage Persistence**
    - In `lib/storage.ts`, create helper functions: `savePalette(palette)`, `getSavedPalettes()`, and `deletePalette(paletteId)`. These will interact with `localStorage`.
    - In `store/paletteStore.ts`, add state for `savedPalettes` and actions to add/remove palettes, synchronizing with the `localStorage` helpers.
- **Task 2: Build the "Saved Palettes" View**
    - Create a new page or a modal to display saved palettes. A separate page `app/saved/page.tsx` is recommended.
    - This page will fetch palettes from the store and display them in a grid.
    - Each palette in the grid should have a "Load" and a "Delete" button.
- **Task 3: Implement Copy-to-Clipboard**
    - In the `ColorCard` component, add an `onClick` handler to the copy button.
    - Use the `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` API to copy the HEX code.
    - Provide visual feedback (e.g., changing the icon, showing a tooltip) for a few seconds after a successful copy.
- **Task 4: Implement Export Functionality**
    - Add "Export as PNG" and "Export as JSON" buttons to the UI.
    - **PNG Export:** The handler will use the `htmlToImage.toPng()` function, passing it a `ref` to the DOM element containing the `PaletteDisplay`. It will then trigger a download of the resulting image.
    - **JSON Export:** The handler will create a JSON string of the current palette's colors, create a Blob, and trigger a download of a `.json` file.

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
- **Task 1: Component Testing**
    - Manually test all components for correct rendering and functionality in both light and dark modes.
    - Test edge cases: invalid HEX code input, empty `localStorage`.
- **Task 2: Cross-Browser Testing**
    - Verify the application works as expected on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Task 3: Responsive Design Testing**
    - Test the UI on various screen sizes (e.g., using browser dev tools) from mobile (360px) to large desktops (1920px). Ensure all elements are accessible and usable.
- **Task 4: Accessibility Audit**
    - Use browser accessibility tools (like Lighthouse) to check for issues.
    - Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and usable via keyboard.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation
- **Task 1: Prepare for Deployment**
    - Clean up code, remove console logs.
    - Create a `.env.example` file if any environment variables were used (none are expected for this project).
- **Task 2: Deploy to Vercel**
    - Push the code to a GitHub repository.
    - Connect the repository to a new Vercel project. Vercel will auto-detect the Next.js framework and configure the build settings.
- **Task 3: Finalize Documentation**
    - Create a comprehensive `README.md` with a project overview, features, how to run locally, and a link to the live deployment.
    - Create a `CHANGELOG.md` to document changes.

## API Endpoints (if applicable)
- Not applicable, as this is a fully client-side application.

## Data Models (if applicable)
### `localStorage` Data Structure
-   **Key**: `color_palette_app_data`
-   **Value**: A JSON string representing an object with the following structure:
    ```json
    {
      "theme": "dark" | "light",
      "palettes": [
        {
          "id": 1678886400000, // Unique identifier, e.g., timestamp
          "colors": ["#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBB"]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Environment Variables
- No environment variables are required for this project as it is fully client-side and does not use any external APIs with secret keys.

## Testing Strategy
The testing strategy will focus on manual end-to-end testing due to the visual and interactive nature of the application.
1.  **Component Functionality**: Each component will be tested for its expected behavior (e.g., does the copy button work? Does the theme switcher work?).
2.  **State Logic**: Test state changes by interacting with the UI. Verify that generating a palette updates the view, saving a palette adds it to the saved list, and deleting removes it.
3.  **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Manually test the full application flow on the latest stable versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.
4.  **Responsive Design**: Use browser developer tools to simulate various device viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop) and ensure the layout adapts correctly and remains usable.

## Deployment Strategy
The application will be deployed to Vercel, the platform created by the developers of Next.js.
1.  **Source Control**: The code will be hosted on a GitHub repository.
2.  **CI/CD**: The Vercel for GitHub integration will be used for continuous deployment. Every push to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a new production deployment. Pull requests will generate preview deployments for review.
3.  **Domain**: Vercel provides a `.vercel.app` domain by default, which is sufficient for this project.

## Maintenance Plan
- **Dependency Updates**: Regularly check for updates to key dependencies (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, etc.) to incorporate bug fixes and security patches. Use `npm outdated` to scan for updates.
- **Bug Fixes**: Address bugs reported by users or found during maintenance checks. Fixes will be pushed to the `main` branch and deployed via Vercel.
- **Documentation**: Keep the `README.md` and any other documentation up-to-date with any changes to the application's functionality or setup process.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Color Generation Logic Complexity** | Medium | Low | Use a well-documented and robust library like `tinycolor2` to handle complex color theory calculations. Encapsulate all logic in a dedicated utility module with clear functions. |
| **Browser `localStorage` Limits** | Low | Low | The application is designed for personal use, so it's unlikely a user will save enough palettes to hit browser limits (typically 5-10MB). The data stored per palette is very small. |
| **Performance on Image Export** | Low | Medium | Exporting a very large or complex palette display to a PNG could be slow on low-end devices. The mitigation is to keep the rendered component for export simple and optimized. `html-to-image` is generally performant for such tasks. |
| **Keeping UI Consistent** | Low | Medium | Using a utility-first framework like Tailwind CSS and a defined component architecture will help maintain UI consistency. Creating a style guide within the `README.md` for colors, fonts, and spacing can further mitigate this. |

## Future Enhancements
- **Palette Naming**: Allow users to add a custom name to their saved palettes.
- **Additional Export Formats**: Add support for exporting palettes as SVG or for specific tools (e.g., CSS variables, Tailwind config).
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Add an option to check the contrast ratio between colors in the generated palette.
- **Undo/Redo**: Allow users to undo accidental palette generations or deletions.
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Allow users to reorder colors within a generated palette.

## Development Guidelines
- Follow industry-standard coding best practices (clean code, modularity, error handling).
- Apply SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles.
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling, adhering to the configuration in `tailwind.config.ts`.
- All credentials and configuration (if any were needed) must be handled via environment variables. Never hardcode secrets.
- Create a comprehensive `README.md` and maintain a `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Tool Usage Instructions
When implementing this plan, the AI code assistant should leverage the following tools and principles:
- **`websearch`**: Use to find up-to-date information on Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and other library-specific implementations or best practices.
- **`designpattern_clear_thought`**: Apply **Modular Architecture** by breaking down the UI into small, reusable components (`ColorCard`, `PaletteDisplay`, `ThemeSwitcher`). Use **State Management** patterns by centralizing application state in the Zustand store.
- **`programmingparadigm_clear_thought`**: Employ **Functional Programming** concepts for data transformation (e.g., generating palettes) and **Component-Based** architecture inherent to React.
- **Asset Generation**: Use `lucide-react` for icons to avoid manual SVG/PNG creation. For the PNG export feature, use the `html-to-image` library to generate the asset on the fly in the client's browser.

## Conclusion
This masterplan provides a complete roadmap for developing the Color Palette Generator application. By following the defined phases, requirements, and guidelines, the final product will be a high-quality, performant, and user-friendly tool that successfully meets all project goals. The technical stack is modern, robust, and perfectly suited for building a client-side SPA.
